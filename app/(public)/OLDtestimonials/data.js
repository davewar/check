My first session with her I explained how overwhelmed and stressed and tired I felt all of the time and that I’m always complaining that I never have enough time. I was feeling worn out and fed up of always feeling so frazzled - and blaming work as the main culprit. Suze made me see that actually work is only a small part of it… I realised that being a people pleaser my whole life, always putting everything and everyone else needs first, was in fact a huge detriment to my own time (and sanity). I can’t thank her enough ",
