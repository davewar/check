            <p className="text-md text-bold">
              Iâ€™m Susan Warwicker, a Life Coach and certified Advanced NLP
              Practitioner with over 25 years experience working on film and tv
              productions
            </p>

            <p className="text-md">
              As a Production Executive, I spearheaded management training to
              ensure HODs were equipped to run departments and their crews
              effectively. I created and ran DEI programs to ensure diverse
              stories and talents were reflected both behind and on screen
            </p>
            <p className="text-md">
              Having climbed the ladder from Runner to Production Executive,
              I've witnessed many talented crew members suffer from bad
              management and burnout due to toxic work environments and
              gruelling shooting schedules
            </p>

            <p className="text-md">
              I decided to leave the industry to address these issues head on.
              By understanding the pace and challenges crew members face, I have
              the insight to help move our industry forward to a happier,
              healthier environment and mindset
            </p>
            <p className="text-md">
              Our industry is losing gifted and experienced people daily but
              through coaching, we can change this
            </p>
