      </p>

      <h3>2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>

      <p>
        We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our
        services, communicate with you, to arrange payment for our services, for
        security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also
        process your information for other purposes with your consent.
      </p>

      <p>
        Technical data that is automatically collected may be used by us to
        analyse how the website is being found and used, and to evaluate the
        effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. It is not used by us to build
        a personal profile.{" "}
      </p>

      <h3>3. HOW DO THIRD PARTIES PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>

      <p>
        Although we do not use automatically collected visitor data to build a
        personal profile on you or identify you personally, Google, which
        provides the analytics service that collects the data, will do this. If
        you are logged into a Google account on your device, it will associate
        your data with the identity details that you have given to Google. What
        is done with that data will depend on the preferences you have expressed
        in the privacy settings of your Google account. If you are not logged
        into a Google account, the data will be associated with a unique
        identifier given to your browser or device.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        For further details about how Google uses your data please see{" "}

      <h3>4. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>

      <p>
        The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to
        explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your
        personal information. As such, we will always rely on one of the
        following legal bases to collect and process your personal information:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Consent. </strong>We may process your information if you have
        given us permission (i.e. consent) to use your personal information for
        a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Performance of a contract. </strong>We may process your personal
        information when we believe it is necessary to fulfil our contractual
        obligations to you, including providing our services or at your request
        prior to entering into a contract with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Legitimate interests. </strong>We may process your information
        when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate
        business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests
        and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your
        personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:
        <br />
        Analyse how our services are used so we can improve them to engage and
        retain users
        <br />
        Evaluate our marketing activities
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Legal obligations. </strong>We may process your information
        where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal
        obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or
        regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your
        information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Vital interests. </strong>We may process your information where
        we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital
        interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential
        threats to the safety of any person.
      </p>

      <h3>5. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>

      <p>
        We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers,
        contractors, or agents ('third parties') who perform services for us or
        on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. We
        have contracts in place with our third parties, which are designed to
        help safeguard your personal information. They commit to protect the
        data they hold on our behalf. The categories of third parties we may
        share personal information with are as follows:
        <br />
        Data Analytics Services
        <br />
        Payment Processors.
      </p>

      <p>
        We do not sell your data to third parties or allow third parties to
        contact you without your permission.

      <p>
        A cookie is a small file that might be placed on a computer or similar
        device when you visit or interact with a website. We may use cookies and
        similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or

        Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer,
        you can usually choose to set your browser to reject cookies or install
        a browser extension to reject cookies. Your browser will also have a
        tool to remove cookies that have already been set. If you choose to
        remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect the functionality of
        parts of our website. To opt out of interest-based advertising by
        Google, see the privacy preferences in the settings of your Google
        account.
      </p>

      <h3>7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>

      <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting, or other legal requirements).{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
        personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such
        information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
        personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
        securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
        processing until deletion is possible.
      </p>

      <h3>8. IS THE INFORMATION ACCURATE AND UP TO DATE?</h3>

      <p>
        We are legally obliged to ensure that the information we have on record
        is accurate and up to date. If your details have changed since we were
        last in touch with you, you are kindly requested to notify us of the new
        details so we can update our records.
      </p>

      <h3>9. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>

      <p>
        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
        organisational security measures to protect the security of any personal
        information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to
        secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or
        information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so
        we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
        unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and
        improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although
        we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission
        of personal information to and from our services is at your own risk.
        You should only access the services within a secure environment.
